      <h1>Morgan and Jason’s Extraordinary Poetrose Collaboration, also known as Angel of Nothing</h1> <br />
All dried and drained of color. Anemic. <br />
All he knows is that he feels everything. <br />
A riptide swallowing the diver, <br />
his breath shortening, rocking
back and forth. <br />
A loose vest, like chain mail <br />
covers his chest, skin wrinkled <br />
and leathery from 57 years of experience. <br />
His form is concealed by fabric, he is floating. <br />
He doesn’t know how this happened to him. <br />
His arms move like smoke from a pipe, <br /> but
not like the wind that carries <br />
everyone’s pain, everyone’s pleasure,
carries the evidence of time <br /> like the
stairs of a cathedral, <br /> he is relieved
to find sanctuary in this space. <br />
His eyes are closed. <br /> He refuses to
share the music that fills his head. <br />
Gratefully he finds that he can’t
see anymore - the pain slowly fades. <br />
They are visible. <br />
They are invisible. <br />
teetering precariously, he wasn’t
allowed to dance, <br /> the pinching
sensation on his arm and the
crunching pain in his foot, <br />
it is not the music of the band playing
in the street <br /> but the unmistakable
sound of another beer can being opened.
